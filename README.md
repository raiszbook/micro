Implementation of REST drivers to facilitate communication and interoperability.
Use of dependency injection to achieve a modular and maintainable design.
Integration of MongoDB as a NoSQL data repository with the support of Spring Data.
Application of functional and reactive programming principles to achieve an agile and efficient system.
Using Lombok to reduce redundant code and improve readability.
Emphasis on the implementation of essential banking functionalities and queries through REST endpoints.
Verification of functionalities through Postman and documentation in Swagger.
